Nineveh Virtual Machine is publically available! Happy new Year everybody! With beginning of this year, I would like to make my vulnerable machine `Nineveh` available for everybody to try it on your own lab! This machine was a part of `Hackthebox` platform.

`Nineveh` has gotten good reputation at `hackthebox` platform since it has more than 255 likes so far. The machine now is retired which means that the machine is still available on `hackthebox` platform but it doesn't worth any points if you get the flags!

This box is designed for educational purposes only. Thus, in order to own/pwn `Nineveh` machine, you need to have pentest skills such:
  - Web Application Pentest
  - Network skills
  - Forensics skills
  - Privilege escalation skills

This machine is configure to have a static IP address for reason! which is `192.168.0.150`. I have test this machine on virtualbox and Proxmox. If you have try it on VMware and works, please let me know so that I can update this post.
